    <string name="text1"> is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language fantasy action-adventure film written and directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta, Namit Malhotra, and Mukerji (in his debut production) – under Dharma Productions, Starlight Pictures, and Prime Focus in association with Star Studios, along with Ranbir Kapoor and Marijke DeSouza. The film serves as the first installment of a planned trilogy, which is itself planned to be part of a cinematic universe titled Astraverse, and stars an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Mouni Roy and Akkineni Nagarjuna. Drawing inspiration from tales in Hindu mythology, the story follows Shiva, an orphan musician with pyrokinetic powers who discovers that he is an astra, a weapon of enormous energy. He attempts to prevent the strongest of the astras, the Brahmāstra, from falling into the hands of dark forces that share a history with him.

The film was first conceived by Mukerji in 2011, with core elements being inspired by Indian history and stories he heard in his childhood. Its development was first revealed in July 2014 with a planned release for 2016, but its official announcement arrived in October 2017 revealing that the film would be titled Brahmāstra and would be a trilogy. Principal photography lasted from February 2018 to March 2022, with filming locations including Bulgaria, London, New York City, Edinburgh, Thailand, Manali, Mumbai and Varanasi. Production and release of the film was delayed multiple times, first due to production delays and monetary constraints, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The films songs are composed by Pritam, with soundtrack lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya.

Brahmhastra Part One  Shiva was theatrically released on 9 September 2022 in standard formats, 3D, 4DX and IMAX 3D by Star Studios in India, 20th Century Studios in North America, and by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures worldwide. It is the first production released under the Star Studios name following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the visual effects, music, score and action sequences while criticism was mostly directed toward the screenplay, story and dialogues. The film emerged as a success at the box office, with an estimated gross of over ₹431 crore (US$54 million) worldwide, making it the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 and one of the highest grossing Indian film of 2022 and became the 20th highest-grossing Indian film of all time after completing theatrical run. Two sequels are being developed simultaneously and slated to release in December 2026 and 2027.</string>
    <string name="text2">Krishna Rao was the son of Peshwa Baji Rao I and his second wife Mastani. He was born out of wedlock, which caused Brahmin priests to refuse to conduct the Hindu upanayana ceremony for him. However, despite this, he received education and military training similar to other sons of the Peshwa family.

After the death of Baji Rao and Mastani, Krishna Rao, also known as Shamsher Bahadur, was taken into the household of Kashibai, Baji Raos widow, and raised as one of her own. He married Laal Kunwar and later Mehrambai. Shamsher Bahadur had a son named Krishna Sinh, who later came to be known as Ali Bahadur.

Shamsher Bahadur played a significant role in the Maratha Conquest of North India. He, along with other Maratha Sardars, fought against the Durrani Empire and conquered Attock, Peshawar, and Multan in 1758. He also participated in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, fighting alongside his cousins from the Peshwa family against the Afghan forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali. Shamsher Bahadur was wounded in the battle and died a few days later at Deeg.

Upon Shamsher Bahadurs death, his son Krishna Sinh (Ali Bahadur) became the Nawab of Banda in present-day Uttar Pradesh, under the vassalage of the Maratha polity. Ali Bahadur expanded his authority over large parts of Bundelkhand and appointed Ramsingh Bhatt as the kotwal of Kalinjar.

Shamsher Bahadur II, the successor of Ali Bahadur, remained loyal to the Maratha polity and fought against the English during the Anglo-Maratha War of 1803. His descendant, Ali Bahadur, fought alongside Rani Lakshmibai in the First War of Indian Independence in 1857. Following his defeat, the state of Banda was abolished.

As for Kashibai, she was the first wife of Bajirao I, the Peshwa, and had four children with him, including Balaji Baji Rao and Ragunath Rao. Kashibai fostered her step-son, Shamsher Bahadur, after Bajiraos death. She belonged to a wealthy banker family and was known as "Laadubai." Kashibai suffered from a type of arthritis and was described as quiet and soft-spoken.</string>

    <string name="text5">The movie starts with a flashback, portraying Nandini and Aditha Karikalans childhood. A young Nandini and Aditha Karikalan love each other. Kundavai did not like Nandini and doesnt want Nandini to be her sister-in-law, but Aditha Karikalan and Nandini were sure that their love will last forever and they will get married and lead a happy life. As time passes, one day Aditha Karikalan took Nandini with him to his palace to introduce her to his family and let them know that she will be the future queen of the kingdom as he is going to marry her. Their romance is discouraged by princess Kundavai and Sembiyan Mahadevi, who consequently expel Nandini and her foster family from the kingdom while Aditha Karikalan is at war and becomes unaware of this. When he returns he is shattered to know that Nandini left the place without telling him and started to search for her everywhere. Nandini is said to have subsequently been taken in by Veerapandiyan, the Pandya ruler.

In the present timeline, Arulmozhi Varman alias Ponniyin Selvans presumed death disheartens the empire; Parthibendran Pallavan meets with Nandini on the coast and she manipulates him to misdirect Aditha Karikalan to Kadambur for the apparent well-being of the empire. Ravidasan and other members of Pandya Aabathudavigal wish to make sure that Ponniyin Selvan is dead. Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan and Poonguzhali row with a surviving and severely ill Ponniyin Selvan, who recollects being rescued by Oomai Rani from being drowned in the sea. They chance upon Azhwarkadiyan Nambi and Sendhan Amudhan, who suggests rushing Ponniyin Selvan to Buddhist monks for treatment. They see Ravidasan and his fellow perpetrators approaching and hence, Vandiyadevan misdirects them and gets himself seized. Elsewhere, Madhurantakan proclaims himself as successor to the throne, receives support from Shivan Adiyars and allies with Khottiga, the Rashtrakuta king, who desires to avenge being defeated by Aditha Karikalan in a battle by marrying his daughter.

Nandini daydreams about Aditha Karikalan by seeing the Tiger Signet ring which was given by Aditha Karikalan to her years before. Later Nandini, Ravidasan and others conspire to assassinate Aditha Karikalan, Sundara Chozhar and Ponniyin Selvan at the same time and Nandini divulges that she plans to kill Aditha Karikalan in Kadambur, where he would be coming; the captured Vandiyadevan, pretending to be unconscious, hears this. Later, he discloses to Nandini that he had seen Oomai Rani, who resembles her and is her mother; and in return, Nandini spares Vandiyadevan from death. Nambi disguises himself and rescues Vandiyadevan, who rushes to meet Kundavai and notifies her of Ponniyin Selvans existence; she professes her feelings for him.</string>
    <string name="text6">Vandiyadevan witnesses Nambi spying over the conference and after exiting from the fortress, he confronts Nambi on a boat making him disclose that he was there to find his foster sister Nandini, who mysteriously disappeared from the house in his absence and later, married a much older Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar. Vandiyadevan later interrupts a convoy of Nandini and informs the latter that he is Nambis acquaintance and would like to deliver her a message from him, intending to gain access to the palace of royalty in Thanjavur bypassing Periya Pazhuvettaraiyars younger brother Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar. Nandini gives him a ring that would help him enter the palace and leaves; Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar, the forts chief-in-charge permits Vandiyadevan as the latter presents the ring and claims that it was given to him by Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar. Vandiyadevan meets Sundara Chozhar and discloses to him about the conspirators but Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar intervenes and attempts to have him apprehended. Vandiyadevan evades and out of misinterpretation, he is taken to Nandinis chamber where she discovers his motives of meeting Kundavai with Aditha Karikalans message and asks him to bring the reply to her first. He obliges and is shown a secret tunnel out of the palace.

Vandiyadevan meets Kundavai through a friend and flower seller Sendhan Amudhan and relays the information about the scheme against the royalty to her. She issues an order to him to bring Ponniyin Selvan back from Lanka and he complies. Madhuranthakas mother Sembiyan Madevi asks Madhuranthaka to desist plotting against Sundara Chozhar and his heirs but is rebuffed. Aditha Karikalan narrates to his companion Parthibendran Pallavan that he was indulged in an affair with Nandini as a teenager but she was not accepted to be the prospective queen of the empire and banished from the city. Aditha Karikalan happened to meet her after several years, tending to his enemy Veerapandiyan, Nandinis father-figure. Infuriated, he beheaded Veerapandiyan and presently, emphasises that Nandini married Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar to take revenge against the Chola dynasty.

Ponniyin Selvan emerges victorious in a battle against Raja Mahinda of Lanka while Vandiyadevan engages a rowing woman Poonguzhali (Samuthirakumari) to take him to Lanka and discovers that she admires Ponniyin Selvan and harbors feelings for him. Divulged to be a spy of Sundara Chozhars well wisher Prime minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar, Nambi arrives at Lanka and chances upon Vandiyadevan. While Vandiyadevan transmits messages for Ponniyin Selvan from Kundavai and Vaanathi (Princess of Kodumbalur) who is expected to marry him, Nambi suggests that it is dangerous for Ponniyin Selvan to return. Kundavai returns to Thanjavur while Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar and other ministers manipulate Sundara Chozhar into dispatching a convoy to bring Ponniyin Selvan back to Thanjavur as a prisoner for rejecting the throne of Ashokas daughter, offered to him by Buddhist monks. Sundara Chozhar commands Kundavai to convince Aditha Karikalan and return with him to Thanjavur as it would be inappropriate for the crown prince to be away from the capital.

In Lanka, meanwhile, Pandya Aabathudavigal, a group of soldiers headed by Ravi Dasan, devoted to Pandya dynasty and avenging the death of their ruler Veerapandiyan, attack Nambi, Ponniyin Selvan and Vandiyadevan intending to assassinate the former. However, they are resisted by Oomai Rani, a veiled woman; Ponniyin Selvan claims that she was the one who rescued him from drowning in the river Ponni when he was a child. Kundavai and Vaanathi make it to Kanchi and Kundavai keeps persuading Aditha Karikalan to return and states that her decision of having Nandini banished from the city was for the dynastys good but he refuses to agree and doesnt oblige to her requests. Meanwhile, a member of Pandya Aabathudavigal reaches Mahinda and gains from him, an army to accomplish the groups plan of assassinating Ponniyin Selvan. Poonguzhali chances upon the convoy, which is assigned on arresting Ponniyin Selvan and realising that it was sent by Pazhuvettaraiyar, she senses a conspiracy and refuses to disclose Ponniyin Selvans details. She reveals about the convoy to Ponniyin Selvan, Vandiyadevan, Nambi, Pallavan (who was sent by Aditha Karikalan to Ponniyin Selvan) and Periya Velar, Vaanathis uncle.

His well wishers repudiate to send him to the convoy but deciding to abide by his fathers orders, Ponniyin Selvan seeks the help of Poonguzhali to meet the convoy and disguises himself as a mahout, while making Vandiyadevan look like a prince. Poonguzhali and Ponniyin Selvan discover that the convoy is ambushed by Pandya Aabathudavigal, who seize Vandiyadevan, misunderstanding him to be Ponniyin Selvan. Intending to save Vandiyadevan, Ponniyin Selvan heads to the sailing ship of Pandya Aabathudavigal and fights the latter but the ship eventually drowns in sea due to a storm while a helpless Poonguzhali tries to rescue them. Ponniyin Selvan and Vandiyadevan are presumed to be dead and the news is relayed to Sundara Chozhar, Kundavai and Aditha Karikalan who are all devastated. Vowing to retaliate his brothers apparent death, Aditha Karikalan sets out to Thanjavur to end the deviously deceptive Nandhini. Meanwhile, Oomai Rani, disclosed to be a lookalike of Nandini, deeply dives into the sea and intends to protect Ponniyin Selvan</string>

They have an instant connection and ishq wala love happens. Micky is a family-oriented guy who cant do without his family members, Tinny is an independent career-oriented girl who needs her own space and life. Only a breakup guru can help them part ways. But is it that simple after the families are involved and the couple is almost about to get engaged? Will they make the ultimate compromise in love and career? Or as Sima Aunty (from Indian Matchmaking says), you can only get 60-70 percent compatibility, you never get 100 percent. Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar touches chords with the modern-age romantic relationships and issues that arent far from reality albeit theres no moral compass that the director defines for his characters.

The first half has no head or tail, and just keeps dragging in its mediocre writing. Micky and Tinnys romance blossoms in the most absurd manner with some cheesy pickup lines that are unapologetically mysogynist, too, but then when has Ranjan bothered about that. He does it in a manner that youd find half of the people in the theatre whistling and cheering on those lines. Even the girl has some really problematic lines like inviting the guy to literally ogle at her, or at least some may feel so. The first half, for most part, it looks as if Ranjan just picked a template out of Imtiaz Alis Tamasha, and replaced Deepika Padukone with Shraddha. A boy and a girl meet on a holiday, get along in the first meeting, lay down relationship rules only to be meant broken later, fall in love and the usual complications occur.</string>
    <string name="text8">An ASI archaeologist, Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtra Akshay Kumar is a strong believer in scientific facts. He does not believe in God. He has already discovered, with an international team from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Japan, the treasure of Raja Dahir and a large reclining Buddha statue - both near the Buddhas of Bamyan in Afghanistan after their destruction by the Taliban (with Dahirs treasure later being divided between India and Pakistan in Islamabad).

In 2007, in an effort by the government to demolish the Rama Setu for building a canal, Aryan is asked to draft a report for the Supreme Court of India showing that the bridge is a natural formation. He initially rejects the offer, not having studied the bridge himself, but after being promised a promotion, he submits a report stating that "Ramayana is an epic fiction, not history" and questions the existence of Rama. His wife Professor Gayatri Nushrratt Bharuccha insists he shouldnt take up the offer. Thus, he is met with complete hostility. In court, the government is humiliated by the report, submitted as an affidavit, as it questions the existence of Rama, and the public is furious. The consequences lead to Aryan getting suspended temporarily. And the hostility later led to Aryans sons bullying in school and Aryan first hand witnesses the hostility shown by the bullys parents.

Meanwhile, Aryan also gets an offer from a rich businessman, Indrakant, Nassar who wants the Rama Setu demolished to save fuel and money for a marine project and he believes due to the existence of Ram Setu, his ships have to travel a long way, hence he wants Ram Setu to be demolished . He tries to persuade Aryan to join an archaeological exploration and research for the Rama Setu. He rejects it, fearing more hostility from the public, but after remembering the incident with his son, he decides to prove the "truth". Aryan hence, accepts the mission and meets project manager Bali and fellow scientists, Dr. Sandra Rebello Jacqueline Fernandez and Dr. Gabrielle, who are assigned to work with him. Initial research shows that Rama Setu is 18,000 years old, which is much older than Rama himself, who according to Pushkar Bhatnagar, in Dating The Era of Lord Ram, was born more than 7,000 years ago. This is not enough for Aryan, so he decides to bring another floating rock from the Rama Setu and uses carbon dating to find its age. He also visits deep underwater and finds the coral reefs. This starts to prove that Rama Setu is indeed man-made, about 7000 years ago, and has a possibility of being built by Rama. He reports this to Indrakant, who appreciates Aryans impartiality towards the mission. However, Indrakant only wants the proof that Rama Setu is older than Rama and hence it is not built by him, so that they can demolish the structure and save money and fuel for their project. He decides to have the trio killed. On another mission to extract more rocks from Rama Setu, Dr. Gabrielle, Dr. Sandra Rebello, and Aryan go deepwater. Suddenly their, submarine stops working and they get stuck, with low oxygen levels, they desperately try to escape. Dr Gabrille acts smart by taking the floating stone along with them as she suspected Bali, in mid sea they are saved by a man on a boat, Anjaneyan Pushpakumaran AP Satya Dev. He rescues them and takes them to a remote island in Sri Lanka, which is currently affected by the ongoing civil war. He agrees to help the trio on their cause. He says that he will help them out, but only for monetary gain. Bali finds that the stone is missing and decides to chase them but AP helps them cross the borders and the stone goes missing in the chase. AP manages to get help of local police who rescue them with a chopper. The trio manage to board the chopper but Gabrielle who happens to stand close to the door is shot by Bali and she falls to death. Aryan now along with Sandra and AP decides to prove the existence of Ram and Ram Setu by doing his research across borders in Srilanka which has existence of Raavana and itself will be a big evidence that Ram Setu was not natural but built by Ram. With everybodys help, Aryan is able to stop the canals construction and prove in court that the Rama Setu was indeed man-made and the story of Ramayana is true (by finding archaeological evidence of Lanka in Ashok Vatika, Seetha Amman Temple, Ella and Sri Pada in Sri Lanka), that Rama could have existed. Later he also comes to the conclusion that Anjaneyan was not an ordinary human, but Lord Hanuman himself.</string>

    <string name="text10">The film is a tragedy about a veteran theatre actor Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar, also known as, Appa (played by Nana Patekar) who has been an acclaimed theatre actor during his days, garnering fame and fortune by acting in plays based on various works, especially those of William Shakespeare. He wins the award and the highest title of Natsamrat.

Subsequently, Appa bequeaths all of his wealth to his children. He never keeps anything to himself and expresses his views very frankly. He does not mind using expletives while expressing his views. Only his wife Kaveri (Medha Manjrekar), whom he fondly calls Sarkar, and his close friend Rambhau (Vikram Gokhale) are able to understand his nature. His daughter-in-law Neha (Neha Pendse) and son Makrand (Ajit Parab) do not seem to appreciate his frank nature, which at times causes embarrassing situations for them when they have visitors or when their daughter hurls expletives at school. The breaking point in their relationship comes when their granddaughter performs a folk dance taught by Appa, which is not appreciated by her mother Neha. An argument follows between them and when they return home, Neha slaps her daughter. The next day, Neha proposes to part ways with them by moving out, a ploy through which she anticipates that Appa will grant them their space. Appa sees through her plan and decides to move out while remarking to his son, "The whole world is a stage, and unfortunately, my part is a sad one."

Appas wife Kaveri is very devoted to him and she does not question his decision. They move to their son-in-law and daughter Vidyas place. Appa continues with his carefree and frank ways, at times laden with few expletives. Their son-in-law, Rahul Barve (Sunil Barve) is a high-ranking engineer in his company and is of a caring nature. Vidya (Mrunmayee Deshpande) also confronts similar embarrassing situations as Neha, but her husband Rahul does not seem to mind it. He appreciates Appas poetry (To be or not to be, that is the question) and his fluent style of recitals. On Vidyas anniversary, Appa comes in an inebriated state and embarrasses Rahuls boss. Although next-day Appa apologizes, Rahul does not seem to mind it and discards it as a one-off incident.

Meanwhile, Appa remembers about his friend Rambhau and pays a visit to him. Rambhau is devastated after the demise of his wife Kumud. He lashes out at Appa for leaving him alone in his final days. The scene that follows is a heart-touching conversation between Karna and Krishna enacted by Rambhau and Appa respectively while Rambhau is lying on his hospital bed. Mesmerized by Rambhaus performance and pitying his condition, Appa grants Rambhau his last wish.

The next day Appa returns to his son-in-laws house. Kaveri tells Appa that Rambhau had overdosed on sleeping pills and that he is no more to which Appa confesses that he gave the pills to him implying that, it was his last wish.

On another occasion, Appa insults Rahuls bosss son when he could not stand his weak adaption of Othello. This irritates Vidya and she confronts her father. She makes their arrangement in her outhouse; however, her husband still stands by Appa and regards this as a non-issue. Vidya makes sure that the outhouse is well maintained and they are taken good care of.

One fine day Vidya misplaces cash given to her by her husband and in a turn of events, she accuses her parents of stealing it. This creates a rift between them. Vidya realizes her mistake later when she finds the money. She apologizes to her parents but it is too late as Appa and Kaveri have already decided to move out. Vidyas husband Rahul is still sympathetic with her parents but cannot change their hearts. On that night, they escape from the outhouse for their ancestral village where they have an old house in a dilapidated state. On the way, they halt at a village, where Kaveri dies of fever. Appa is destroyed by this loss. He is supported by a boot polishwala named Raja. Raja is extremely poor and a homeless person who lives with his family under a bridge. Appa is at times in a delusional state and suffers from the fact that the grandeur with which he had lived as an actor is now making his pain unbearable in his state of loneliness and poverty. Appa serves tea at a tea stall where he enthralls his customers with his poetry recitals and dialogue from his plays. A man named Siddharth(Sarang Sathaye), who has respect and great fondness for acting, continuously follows Appa, since, for Siddharth, he is a noble actor and an idol. Appa hides his real identity from Siddharth and refuses to acknowledge that he is Natsamrat. Siddarth, however, continues with his conviction regarding Appa being the great actor.

One day, Appa reads in the papers that his favorite theatre had burnt down in a fire. He goes there immediately and is completely shattered to see the theatre reduced to ashes. Siddharth also arrives there as he was following Appa. Here Appa starts reliving his old memories and also accepts Siddharths claim that he is the real Natsamrat Ganpatrao when Siddharth reveals that he knew all about him and his past. His family and Raja also come there to find him. They request him to come home with him and to live with them but he refuses. The film ends magnificently albeit it has a tragic end. Appa is in a delusional state and shuffles between reality and the great personalities he had once portrayed as an actor on the very same stage. He gives his last performance on the theatre stage for Siddharth and says that "Do you understand, dear Siddarth, this is what theatre acting is all about? To fulfill ones longing" He unexpectedly screams by placing a hand on his throat and collapses. Immediately everyone runs to hold him, but they find that he has already departed.</string>
